# Spatial modelling via QGIS-R integration 

## Instalation

You can find the R scripts for spatial modelling in the `rscripts` folder.

Every R script is stored in a `*.rsx` file. Along with every `*.rsx` comes a `*.rsx.help` file containing the instructions to use the R script.

To use an R script, you must download both `*.rsx` and `*.rsx.help` files and save them in your local QGIS `rscripts` folder.

If you want to download all R scripts as a ZIP file, then simply [click here][download].
