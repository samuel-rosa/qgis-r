# Spatial modelling via QGIS-R integration 

## Installation

You can find the R scripts for spatial modelling in the `rscripts` folder above.

Every R script is composed of two files: a `*.rsx` file with the R code and a `*.rsx.help` file with instructions on how to use the R script.

To use an R script, you must save both `*.rsx` and `*.rsx.help` files in your local QGIS `rscripts` folder. On Linux machines, this generally is located at:

```
/home/<your-name-here>/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/processing/rscripts
```

On Windows machines, the QGIS `rscripts` folder is generally located at:

```
C:/Users/<seu-nome-aqui>/.qgis/processing/rscripts
```
